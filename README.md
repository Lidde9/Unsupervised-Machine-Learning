# Unsupervised Machine Learning
 Kmeans Clustering, PCA and Visualizations

Wine has certain key features which are key for quality and a "good" wine. In this project, unsupervised machine learning is used to categorize/cluster, principle component analysis and visualize wine characteristics. This is done with Kmeans clustering and PCA. The data is on 6,600 different wines from Vino Verde region in Portugal.
